      <p>Computer programming(Coding) is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result or to perform a specific task</p>
        <br>
    Some Take coding like a business but few take it as a hobby, I don't take it as a business as i quite young but i want to persue when i get older .
        
    It helps me not to kill time but also to make apps that i could never think of .
    I like coding and am going to persue it when i get older but for now i would take it as a hobby . I would probably as i career as for when i am much older.
